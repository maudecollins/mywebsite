            My name is Maude Collins and I am an aspiring software engineer. 
            I grew up in Seattle, Washington skiing and hiking with my family. 
            The summer going into 8th grade we moved to New Canaan, CT, and I
            transitioned from a liberal arts carefree school to an all-girls,
            intensely catholic, uniform-wearing middle school. 
            I was lucky enough to be exposed to Robotics, and Computer Science 
            early on in my highschool career. During my Senior year I took 
            AP Computer Science and thoroughly enjoyed it, in spite of the 
            late nights of coding. After high school I attended Franklin & 
            Marshall College. I am currently a rising senior with a double major
            in Computer Science and Mathematics. My hope is to be a software engineer
            after graduation. However, I strive to eventually go back to school
            to become an environmental engineer.
