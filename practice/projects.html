            Implemented two common scheduling strategies.
            using various data structures to compare their strengths 
            and weaknesses. Had 15 total files for this project, all written
            in C++. Debugged and worked through the various super classes 
            and subclasses.

            Implemented the RSA alogirthm, one of the 
            first public key cryptographic systems that is still
            used today. Generated a pair of matched keys, the public
            key and the private key. Used the public key to encrypt 
            a message and used the private key to decrypt the message. 
            Worked through bugs and various test cases.
